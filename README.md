- 👀 I’m interested in EdTech
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my EdTech Company 
- 📫 How to reach me ntiriowusu@gmail.com
I need help with my EdTech Platform which seeks to provide computer studies for kids in Africa. 
Africa is a continent with very little computer literates which makes it difficult to start Tech Companies with skilled human capital.
I seek to change that with my EdTech, Krakyeni. Krakyeni is under construction and I need help with building the platform. I will like to partner with people who have interest in building Krakyeni.
Check our website which is also under construction. krakyeni.com
